# 100 Days of GO

This repository is a journal of my path to learning GO.
By the end of the 100 days, you should be able to follow along by day and learn Go as well.

### Day #1 21 July 2021 

This should take you 60 min, and you can expect to learn how to setup a Go development enviornment and basic Git Hub Actions.


## Exercise 1: Install GO and your choice of Integrated Development Enviornment (IDE)

**Time: 15 minutes**


* [Download GoLang][https://golang.org/]Click the Blue link for your Operating System and follow the install guide  
* [Download Vs Code][https://code.visualstudio.com/download]

After you install both here is a screen shot of what it should look like after you run `go version`

## To follow along follow these steps 

**Time: 10 minutes**

Clone the existing repositiory to have the hello world go application, and the yml files needed for the github action. 

``
git clone https://github.com/Cobra16319/100_Days_Of_Go.git
``  

Use git tags to iterate with the CI system and track any changes updating the yml file logically as needed.

git push --tags
``
